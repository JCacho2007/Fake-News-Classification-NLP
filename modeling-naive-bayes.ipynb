    "### Model Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I will be modeling with `MultinomialNB`, which is a Naive Bayes classifier. Naive Bayes (as in Bayes' theorem) is a conditional probability model that assumes independence between the feature variables. While this is not a realistic assumption for a natural language model, the Naive Bayes classifier can make predictions with surprising accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modeling Strategy\n",
    "Before I can begin modeling, I need to turn my text data into numeric data using `CountVectorizer`. This transformer will create a matrix of values, where the columns represent every word that appears in the corpus, and the rows represent each document in the corpus. The values are gross counts of how many times a word appears in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these methods have hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize model performance, so I will perform a grid search using a pipeline with `CountVectorizer` and `MultinomialNB` to find the best parameters for both in the context of one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grid search will test 3 different `CountVectorizer` hyperparameters:\n",
    "1. `max_features`: how many features to extract (chosen by highest total frequency)\n",
    "2. `min_df`: the minimum number of documents in which a feature must appear\n",
    "3. `max_df`: the maximum percentage of documents in which a feature can appear\n",
    "\n",
    "and 2 different `MultinomialNB` hyperparameters:\n",
    "1. `alpha`: the additive smoothing (Laplace/Lidstone smoothing) parameter to be used on each feature\n",
    "2. `fit_prior`: whether the model will learn the prior probabilities of the classes"

    "The grid search found that `max_features` should be None to optimize the model's performance. However, without a feature limit, the model had ~4000 features after vectorization. I had to reduce `max_features` to 1187, the number of rows in `X_train`, to reduce collinearity. To get the highest possible accuracy score from this model, I would need to gather more data so that the model could use more features to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline accuracy score for the data is the score I would get if I predicted the majority class for every data point. The majority class here, /r/TheOnion, holds around 60% of the data. If I were to predict that every document in the data belonged to /r/TheOnion, I would get an accuracy score of 60%. That is to say, if a model does not predict subreddit membership with greater than 60% accuracy, then it is not a very good model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's accuracy score is 86.6%, which is well above the baseline score of 60%. This means that the model correctly predicted the class 86.6% of the time. The model has relatively high sensitivity at 84.8%, meaning that 84.8% of the posts that were actually from /r/TheOnion were correctly predicted to be from /r/TheOnion. The model has higher specificity, 89.3%, which means that 89.3% of posts that belong to /r/News were correctly predicted to be from /r/News.\n",

    "In a real-world application, it is equally important to me that this model be able to correctly predict when a post is satirical **and** when it is real. The positive class in this case is does not hold more weight than the negative class, therefore I would rather the model be very accurate than very sensitive or very specific. This model, however, is all three, which means that for my purposes it is a great model."
